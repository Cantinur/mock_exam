//â€¢ Implement a test class called TestAnimal. Write the beginning of the program through public static void main.
// In the test class create two different Animal objects (one Goat and one Lion) with a Stable only for the Goat.
// Use the different constructors to do that. Both goat and lion should print its toString. Call the feedAnimal of
// the Goat one time with a food he/she likes and one with food he/she does not like. Print both reactions
// of the goat. (6 points)
